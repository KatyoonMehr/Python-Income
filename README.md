## Python-Income
#Abstract:
Different studies suggested that there are some features affected the amount of earnings people can make, 
whether they are employed or self-employed. The purpose of this study is to find the best model, using 
Logistic regression, KNN, Adaboost, Random Forest and SVM, to find out what are the features affecting 
the income.

#Methods:
logistic regression, KNN, adaboost, random forest, SVM  
 
Conclusion: Logistic Regression and SVM failed to estimate any values for first and last class (<25K and >150K). 
Random forest with Accuracy of 0.72 for 1000 estimator as the optimal number of estimators is slightly better 
than KNN and Adaboost. The precisions for the first 3 classes are above 70%.
